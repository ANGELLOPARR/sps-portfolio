    <div id="about-text">
      <p id="first-about">i'm currently a soon-to-be senior at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.
        most people just call it "Cal Poly" for short. my major is computer science and hopefully soon i'll
        be a full-time software engineer.
      </p>
      <p>sometimes i think i have too many interests in the computer science field, and it often gets hard
        choose my favorites.
      </p>
      <p>one of my favorite things to do is develop full-stack web applications. initially, i taught myself
        how to develop frontend applications because i loved the design aspect of it. though i've never
        been great with a pencil and paper, i found that i could translate my thoughts into designs using
        code much more effectively. as i advanced in my computer science education, i realized the uses
        of backend code as well, and soon taught myself that as well.

      <p class="card-desc">for a final project in my data science class I worked in a group
        with two other students that compared a variety of machine learning models in their
        ability to predict whether someone would default on their next credit card payment.

      <p class="card-desc">my cs buddy kevin and i made a web application called quarantine cards.
        it's a multiplayer card game turned into a web application. it was meant to help friends
        reconnect during the stay-at-home orders and encourage social distancing.

      <p class="card-title">explore polytech</p>
      <p class="card-desc">with my software engineering group of 2 other people,
        we used an agile project management approach to develop a full-stack web application
        where students could give their experiences about technical electives at Cal Poly.
        this would help newer students decide what electives interest them most.
